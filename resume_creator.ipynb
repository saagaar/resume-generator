We know from research that women and other people from underrepresented, minority, or marginalised backgrounds often only apply if they think they meet all the criteria, but please don’t let that stop you from applying. We’d really love to hear from you and to see what unique skills and experience you’d bring to the role, even if it is not everything we have listed above.\n",

So if you need some time to go to the gym during quiet times, want to break up your day to look after your kids, or feel like going for a walk around that 3pm slump, it’s all fine. We have team members around the globe, so you may need to attend an early morning or early evening meeting occasionally.\n",

      "\n",
      "We value flexible work and healthy boundaries. That’s why we support the right to disconnect. While some after-hours availability may occasionally be required — for example, to respond to critical system issues, urgent client queries, or time-sensitive project needs — we aim to keep this to a minimum and always prioritise balance.\n",
